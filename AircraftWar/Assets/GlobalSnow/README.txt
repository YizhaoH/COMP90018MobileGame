How to use this asset
---------------------
Firstly, you should run the Demo Scene provided to get an idea of the overall functionality.
Later, please read the documentation and experiment with the system.

Hint: to quick start using the asset just add GlobalSnow script to your camera. It will show up in the Game view. Customize it using the custom inspector.


Documentation/API reference
---------------------------
The PDF is located in the Documentation folder. It contains instructions on how to use this asset as well as a useful Frequent Asked Question section.

Future updates
--------------

All our assets follow an incremental development process by which a few beta releases are published on our support forum (kronnect.com).
We encourage you to signup and engage our forum. The forum is the primary support and feature discussions medium.

Of course, all updates of Global Snow will be eventually available on the Asset Store.
